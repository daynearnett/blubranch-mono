# BluBranch — Claude Code Project Context

> **What this file is:** Context for Claude Code sessions. It captures all architectural decisions, mockup analysis, and implementation plans from the initial planning chat so you can pick up exactly where we left off.

## Project overview

BluBranch is a two-sided professional networking and job marketplace platform built specifically for blue-collar skilled workers, tradespeople, and contractors. Workers showcase experience, find local opportunities, and connect with peers. Employers and contractors post and fill jobs.

**Tagline:** "The professional network built for the Blue Collar."

## Key reference docs

- [docs/TESTFLIGHT.md](./docs/TESTFLIGHT.md) — first-time iOS TestFlight setup playbook. `eas login` / `eas init` / `eas build` / `eas submit` step-by-step, plus what's needed in the Apple Developer portal.
- [docs/TESTFLIGHT-LESSONS.md](./docs/TESTFLIGHT-LESSONS.md) — gotchas hit during the first iOS TestFlight cycle (cert limits, SDK version requirements, SDK 52 → 55 launch crash, version-bump conventions). Read this **before** the next iOS rebuild.
- [docs/RAILWAY-DEPLOY.md](./docs/RAILWAY-DEPLOY.md) — API deployment playbook for Railway: provisioning Postgres + PostGIS + Redis, env var matrix, custom-domain setup for `api-staging.blubranch.com` and `api.blubranch.com`, post-deploy seed step.
- [docs/RAILWAY-LESSONS.md](./docs/RAILWAY-LESSONS.md) — gotchas from the first Railway deploy cycle (Nix package naming, pnpm PATH resolution failures, monorepo root-directory setting, NODE_ENV stripping devDeps, `${{Service.VAR}}` reference syntax). Read this **before** the next deploy if anything changes in `nixpacks.toml` or service settings.

## Reference architecture

This project is modeled on the [Taist monorepo](https://github.com/TaistApp/taist-mono) — a mobile marketplace (React Native + Expo) connecting customers with local personal chefs. We're adapting that proven architecture with two key changes:

1. **Backend:** Node.js (Express or Fastify) instead of PHP/Laravel
2. **Multi-form-factor:** Mobile + tablet + desktop (Taist is mobile-only)

Everything else mirrors Taist: Railway hosting, Expo EAS builds, Stripe Connect payments, Firebase push notifications, Twilio SMS, Resend email, and a React admin panel.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Monorepo | Turborepo | Workspace management |
| Mobile/tablet/desktop | React Native + Expo (SDK 52+) | Single codebase, web export for desktop |
| Backend | Node.js (Express or Fastify) | REST API |
| Database | PostgreSQL + PostGIS | Geospatial job matching is critical |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe queries, migrations |
| Cache/queues | Redis + BullMQ | Sessions, job queues, caching |
| Real-time | Socket.io | In-app messaging |
| Push notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging | |
| SMS | Twilio | Phone verification, alerts |
| Email | Resend | Transactional email |
| Payments | Stripe Connect | Employer pays, worker gets paid |
| Maps | Google Maps API | Job location, worker radius |
| Admin panel | React web app | Separate app in monorepo |
| Hosting | Railway | Backend + DB + Redis |
| Mobile builds | Expo EAS | TestFlight (iOS), APK/Play Console (Android) |
| Incorporation | Clerky (Delaware C-Corp) | In progress |

## Two-sided user model

BluBranch has two user types (analogous to Taist's customer/chef split):

- **Workers (tradespeople):** Free to use. Create profiles showcasing trade, skills, certifications, portfolio photos, work history. Browse and apply to jobs. Post to the social feed. Connect with peers.
- **Employers/contractors:** Pay to post jobs ($49 basic / $129 pro / $299/mo unlimited). Create company profiles. Review applicants. Message workers directly (on paid plans).

Single `users` table with a `role` enum (`worker | employer | admin`), with role-specific profile tables joined via foreign key.

## Key features from mockups

See `docs/MOCKUP-ANALYSIS.md` for the full screen-by-screen breakdown. Summary:

- **Auth:** Email/password + Apple + Google + Facebook sign-in. "Workers always free" messaging.
- **Signup:** 3-step wizard (account → trade selection → location/radius)
- **Profile creation:** 4-step wizard (photo & bio → skills & certs → work photos → privacy settings)
- **Home feed:** Social feed with posts (likes/comments/shares) + inline job cards ("Jobs near you")
- **Worker profile:** 3 tabs (About, Portfolio, Posts) with stats (connections, posts, rating, endorsements), badges (union, license verified, open to work)
- **Job board:** Filterable by trade, sortable by distance. Featured/boosted listings. Quick Apply flow.
- **Job detail:** Full listing with requirements, benefits tags, employer info, applicant count
- **Employer posting:** 6-step wizard (choose plan → company info → job details → perks & boosts → review → confirmation)
- **Navigation:** 5 bottom tabs — Feed, Finances, Post (+), Jobs, Profile

## Responsive layout strategy

Mobile (< 768px) → bottom tab navigator (standard mobile)
Tablet (768–1024px) → collapsible sidebar + content area
Desktop (> 1024px) → persistent sidebar + content + detail panel (three-column)

Use `useWindowDimensions()` hook + conditional navigator swap. Don't build separate screens — build screen layouts that rearrange the same components.

## Environments (matching Taist)

| Environment | URL | Purpose |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| Production | `api.blubranch.com` | Live users |
| Staging | `api-staging.blubranch.com` | Pre-release testing |
| Admin (prod) | `admin.blubranch.com` | Production management |
| Admin (staging) | `admin-staging.blubranch.com` | Test admin features |

## Build phases

See `docs/PHASE-ROADMAP.md` for the detailed week-by-week plan. High-level:

| Phase | What | Weeks |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | Monorepo scaffold, tooling, CI | 1–2 |
| 1 | Auth + user profiles | 3–5 |
| 2 | Responsive layout system | 4–6 (parallel) |
| 3 | Job marketplace core (PostGIS) | 6–10 |
| 4 | Messaging, notifications, real-time | 10–13 |
| 5 | Payments (Stripe Connect) | 13–15 |
| 6 | Admin panel | 14–16 (parallel) |
| 7 | Testing, hardening, launch prep | 16–20 |

**Highest-risk item:** Phase 3 geospatial matching (PostGIS). Prototype early.

## Design tokens (not final — will be swapped)

The mockups use a dark navy / orange / white palette. Colors are not finalized but the token structure should be set up for easy swapping:

```
--color-primary: #E8713A        (orange — CTAs, accents)
--color-primary-dark: #1B3A5C   (dark navy — headers, profile banner)
--color-cta-dark: #1E3D5C       (dark blue — secondary CTAs like "Take me to my feed")
--color-background: #FFFFFF
--color-text-primary: #1A1A1A
--color-text-secondary: #6B7280
--color-success: #22C55E        (verified badges)
--color-danger: #EF4444         (urgent badges)
```

## Claude Code conventions

- When creating files, follow the monorepo structure above
- Use TypeScript everywhere (strict mode)
- Use Zod for runtime validation in `packages/shared`
- Use Prisma for all database operations
- Prefer Fastify over Express unless there's a specific reason
- Use `pnpm` as the package manager (Turborepo preference)
- All environment variables go in `.env.example` with placeholder values
- Write tests alongside implementation (Vitest for backend, Jest for mobile)
